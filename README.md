# jinja2_website_translations
A static simple example website created using jinja2, with support for translations

## Description

I want to help translating https://electioncal.us/ to Spanish. I have worked with jinja2 templates for ansible stuff, but never for making websites.

This is a repo to test how to build a mini site that is simple enough to test the translation integrations for jinja2 under python3.

## Status

- [x] Basic site.
- [ ] Translations with gettext.
- [ ] Documenation on how to use.
